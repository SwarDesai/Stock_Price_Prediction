# Stock Price Prediction using kNN algorithm
This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts stock prices using the kNN algorithm. This project is designed to help you understand and implement predictive modeling for stock pricing.
# Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the stock prices based on various features and attributes. It utilizes the kNN algorithm, a powerful method, to build a robust regression model. In stock prrediction system, the entire process of decision making for buying and selling has been automated. Using these systems, traders can easily buy and sell a stock based on open, high, low and close prices of previous dates.
# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:  
   * Stock_Price.ipynb : Jupyter notebooks with the code for data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
   * README.md : The document you are currently reading.
